Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process data and learn patterns through layers of transformations. Each connection has a weight, adjusted during training to minimize errors, enabling the network to make accurate predictions or decisions.

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers, or "deep" architectures, allowing them to learn complex representations from large datasets. Deep learning powers a variety of applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more, making it a cornerstone of modern AI.

This repository includes resources and projects for the study of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. It covers fundamental concepts like neural network architecture, backpropagation, and various types of networks (e.g., convolutional and recurrent neural networks). Through practical examples, the repository demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to real-world problems using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
